# Welcome to my profile!
I'm an electrical engineering student at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. Sometimes I like to spend my time creating projects, writing down ideas and putting into practice the things I learn at college. 

⚙️ I use: .c, .cpp, .py, .v

⚡ Here are some of my projects, tests and ideas =)
